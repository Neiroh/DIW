                        quite energetic. Easily distinguishable from all the other Smurfs, Papa Smurf has a bushy white mustache and beard and is typically dressed in red pants and a matching red Phrygian cap, making him the only Smurf who does not wear
                        white. He was introduced in Peyo's 1958 Johan and Peewit story "La Flûte à Six Trous", the first appearance of the Smurfs.</p>

                        superhuman strength. He fell into a cauldron of the Gauls' magic potion when he was a baby, causing him to be the only Gaul in Asterix's village who is in a permanent state of superhuman strength. Because of this already enormous
                        strength, Obelix is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again, a ban he regards as being tremendously unfair.</p>

                        but also condensed milk and other items. Pooh is very social. After Christopher Robin, his closest friend is Piglet.</p>
